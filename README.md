# Autonomous Robot 
Welcome to the repository for our robot built for the **Robot Design and Competition 2024** at the Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering, University of Moratuwa. This year's competition is inspired by the **Stranger Things** universe and takes place in the fictional town of **Hawkins**, where robots must complete a series of interdimensional tasks to prevent a catastrophic merging of dimensions.

## üß© Task-by-Task Approach

Our robot is designed to autonomously complete each of the 8 tasks in the Hawkins Interdimensional Challenge using a combination of sensor fusion, mechanical actuation, and intelligent algorithms. Below is a task-wise breakdown of our approach.

### üõ†Ô∏è Mechanical Design

Our robot is compact and modular:
- **Base Size**: 24 cm √ó 18 cm
- **Height**: ~15 cm
- **Arm Mechanism**: Equipped with a custom-designed 2-DOF mechanical arm capable of gripping, lifting, and placing boxes. The arm performs actions like grabbing/dropping based on pre-programmed sequences.
- **Mobility**: Dual DC motor system with encoder feedback for precise movement and PID-based control.

### Initial Mechanical Design

### üî¢ Task 1: Counting and Line Navigation

**Objective**: Read a barcode made of lines with two different widths and decode it into a binary number.

**Our Approach**:
- **IR Sensors** detect the difference between 3 cm (narrow) and 6 cm (wide) white lines.
- **Encoder-based PID control** ensures the robot moves straight during line scanning.
- A custom **state machine** captures the sequence of line widths and converts it into binary format, ignoring the last 3 lines as instructed.

---

### üì¶ Task 2: Maze Navigation and Box Manipulation

**Objective**: Navigate a virtual maze, pick up a virtual box, and move it to the correct checkpoint.

**Our Approach**:
- Uses an **ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)** to detect presence/absence of walls and determine if a path is blocked.
- **Optimized maze-solving algorithm** identifies box position and calculates the shortest valid route.
- The robot indicates **box pickup** with a blue LED, restricts motion to forward/backward while carrying, and releases at junctions to change direction.

---

### üî¥üîµ Task 3: Color Line Following

**Objective**: Follow a Red or Blue line based on the previously selected checkpoint.

**Our Approach**:
- **Color sensor** discriminates between Red, Blue, and other colors.
- **IR sensor array** is used for following the detected colored path.
- Line-following is dynamically adjusted using PID for stability even on intersecting or broken lines.

---

### ‚ö™ Task 4: Dotted Line Navigation

**Objective**: Follow a discontinuous white dashed line.

**Our Approach**:
- **IR sensors + Encoder PID**: While on visible segments, IR-based line following is active.
- When the line disappears, robot switches to a **"go-straight-until-line"** mode using encoder PID until the next segment is detected.
- This cycle continues until the end of the dashed path is reached.

---

### üö™ Task 5: Portal Navigation

**Objective**: Pass through a gate that opens and closes every 5 seconds.

**Our Approach**:
- **Proximity sensor** (e.g., IR or ultrasonic) checks the gate status.
- Once the gate is confirmed open, the robot **quickly navigates through** using a timed and pre-planned burst movement.
- Post-portal, the robot switches from **white line on black** to **black line on white** detection logic.

---

### üìè Task 6: Box Arrangement

**Objective**: Arrange three boxes in ascending or descending order based on previously followed color (Blue = Ascending, Red = Descending).

**Our Approach**:
- The robot‚Äôs **mechanical arm** picks and places boxes using a **gripper** mechanism.
- **Proximity sensor mounted on the arm** is used to detect box height (5 cm, 10 cm, 15 cm).
- Sorting algorithm determines the pickup and placement sequence based on height and color context.

---

### üï≥Ô∏è Task 7: Hidden Task and Chamber Insertion

**Objective**: Pick a small box and insert it into a chamber after completing a hidden task.

**Our Approach**:
- Robot uses the **arm mechanism** to grab the box.
- Follows a line to reach the chamber.
- Hidden task logic is modular and adaptable ‚Äì we use dynamic code modules to adjust during live coding.
- The box is aligned and **inserted into the chamber slot** with mechanical precision.

---

### ü™ô Task 8: Coin Drop and Task Completion

**Objective**: Navigate uneven terrain and drop a coin at the 'X' mark to light a bulb.

**Our Approach**:
- Robot navigates over **stacked Styrofoam tiles** using stable wheelbase and controlled speed.
- A **custom-designed coin dropper system** is integrated into the chassis.
- Once the robot detects the marked 'X' (via position tracking or visual cue), it **releases the coin** using a solenoid or servo trigger mechanism, successfully closing the circuit to light the bulb.

Each module in our robot‚Äîfrom motion control to manipulation‚Äîhas been carefully integrated to ensure reliable, autonomous performance across all eight tasks. We focus on **robustness, adaptability, and precision** to complete the Hawkins Interdimensional Challenge.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Live Coding Round

During the event, each team must participate in a **30-minute live coding session**. A region of the arena (Task 7) will be kept **secret** until then and revealed for this purpose. It is designed to test adaptability and real-time coding under pressure.
